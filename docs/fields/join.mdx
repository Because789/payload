The Join Field is used to make Relationship fields in the opposite direction. It is used to show the relationship from
the other side. The field itself acts as a virtual field, in that no new data is stored on the collection with a Join
field. Instead, the Admin UI surfaces the related documents for a better editing experience and is surfaced by Payload's APIs.

The Join field is useful in scenarios including:

- To see related `Products` on an `Order`
- To view and edit `Posts` belonging to a `Category`
- To work with any bi-directional relationship data

For the Join field to work, you must have an existing [relationship](./relationship) field in the collection you are
joining. This will reference the collection and path of the field of the related documents.
To add a Relationship Field, set the `type` to `join` in your [Field Config](./overview):

```ts
import type { Field } from 'payload/types'

export const MyJoinField: Field = {
  // highlight-start
  name: 'relatedPosts',
  type: 'join',
  collection: 'posts',
  on: 'category',
  // highlight-end
}

// relationship field in another collection:
export const MyRelationshipField: Field = {
  name: 'category',
  type: 'relationship',
  relationTo: 'categories',
}
```

In this example, the field is defined to show the related `posts` when added to a `category` collection. The `on` property is used to
specify the relationship field name of the field that relates to the collection document.

## Join Field Data

When a document is returned that for a Join field is populated with related documents. The structure returned is an object with:

- `docs` an array of related documents or only IDs if the depth is reached
- `hasNextPage` a boolean indicating if there are additional documents

```json
{
  "id": "66e3431a3f23e684075aae9c",
  "relatedPosts": {
    "docs": [
      {
        "id": "66e3431a3f23e684075aaeb9",
        // other fields...
        "category": "66e3431a3f23e684075aae9c",
      },
      // { ... }
    ],
    "hasNextPage": false
  },
  // other fields...
}
```

## Query Options

The Join Field supports custom queries to filter, sort, and limit the related documents that will be returned. In addition to the specific query options for each Join Field, you can pass `joins: false` to disable all Join Field from returning. This is useful for performance reasons when you don't need the related documents.

The following query options are supported:

| Property    | Description                                                  |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **`limit`** | The maximum related documents to be returned, default is 10. |
| **`where`** | An optional `Where` query to filter joined documents.        |
| **`sort`**  | A string used to order related results                       |

These can be applied to the local API, GraphQL, and REST API.

### Local API

By adding `joins` to the local API you can customize the request for each join field by the `name` of the field.

```js
const result = await db.findOne('categories', {
  where: {
    title: {
      equals: 'My Category'
    }
  },
  joins: {
    relatedPosts: {
      limit: 5,
      where: {
        title: {
          equals: 'My Post'
        }
      },
      sort: 'title'
    }
  }
})
```

### Rest API

The rest API supports the same query options as the local API. You can use the `joins` query parameter to customize the request for each join field by the `name` of the field. For example, an API call to get a document with the related posts limited to 5 and sorted by title:

`/api/categories/${id}?joins[relatedPosts][limit]=5&joins[relatedPosts][sort]=title`

You can specify as many `joins` parameters as needed for the same or different join fields for a single request.

### GraphQL
